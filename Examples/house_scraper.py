# This script is used to scrape property information from the website - Realestate.com.au, to
# scrape and analyze data for educational purposes only. The Data scraped from this exercise
# will not be made public and is subject to learn practical machine learning and hypothesis
# building exercises only. This script is only used to perform the scraping operation while
# the analysis operations are performed separately as either Map Reduce functions in CouchDB
# or Python code, using Pandas, Scikit, and Matplotlib.
